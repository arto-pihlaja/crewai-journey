# CrewAI Starter Template

## Introduction
This project is the code from CrewAI's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/). 

The script will spin up a Crew of agents to research the latest AI trends in healthcare.

CrewAI is built and maintained by [@joaomdmoura](https://x.com/joaomdmoura)

## Running the Script
You can run the agent as soon as you add your OpenAI API key to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the Secrets tool.

CrewAI use gpt-4 by default unless you change the `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` variable in the Secrets tool.
